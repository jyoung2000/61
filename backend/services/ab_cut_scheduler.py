"""Editorial A/B reverse-cut scheduler for multi-speaker dialogue.

Today, two speakers that cannot fit simultaneously in a 9:16 crop get
either:

  * ``wide_master`` (letterboxed, both tiny), or
  * ``split_screen`` (two stacked crops, both fixed).

Humans cut A → B → A → B on each speaker turn, holding on the current
speaker for their beat plus a short tail so the listener's reaction is
caught. This module plans that A/B (or A/B/C for 3-seat panels)
schedule in terms of the existing ``ReframeSegment`` vocabulary.

Decision inputs:
  * two (or three) face slots present in the overlap region,
  * alternating speaker turns each ≥ ``ab_min_turn_sec``,
  * faces don't fit inside the same crop at ≥ 30 % of source width
    (i.e. ``multi_region_layout`` returned infeasible or wide-master),
  * content type is NOT ``multi_speaker_panel`` (panels prefer a
    fixed panoramic wide) UNLESS explicitly overridden for a 3-seat
    rotation.

Output: a list of :class:`AbCutSegment` that the reframe segmenter
splices into the overlap region as per-speaker tracking crops with
``SACCADE`` eases between them (see :mod:`camera_events`).

Cut-on-reaction: when the audio analyzer flags laughter / gasp / crowd
within ±0.4 s of a non-speaker face being off-screen, the scheduler
inserts a reaction beat pointing at that non-speaker.
